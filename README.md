Hello there peeps! I've decided to create this repo as it concerns me about people's Cloudflare security as if newbies don't know how to protect their websites correctly, it could bring down whatever they're using their domain for (unless it's a big service like GitHub, Vercel, etc.) What this repo is about is to help them protect their websites.
